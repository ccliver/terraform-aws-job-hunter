"""Worker Lambda handler.

Triggered by SQS. Each message contains a company name, careers URL, and
optional ATS type. Dispatches to the appropriate ATS handler to fetch and
parse job listings, applies a keyword filter, then writes new postings to
the DynamoDB `jobs` table. Deduplication is achieved by hashing
company+title+url as the DynamoDB partition key (job_id).

ATS backends:
    greenhouse - JSON API
    lever      - JSON API
    workday    - Unofficial JSON API (cxs)
    builtin    - Built In (builtin.com) search results page. Aggregates
                 postings across many employers, so each returned job carries
                 its own "company" key instead of relying on the SQS
                 message's company_name. Jobs from companies already tracked
                 directly elsewhere in companies.json are skipped.

Environment variables expected:
    JOBS_TABLE      - DynamoDB table name for job postings
    COMPANIES_TABLE - DynamoDB table name for tracked companies (used by the
                       builtin ATS backend to skip already-tracked companies)
    LOCATION          - Comma-separated location substrings to additionally
                         keep (OR'd together) for every ATS backend except
                         builtin; blank disables it (remote-only)
    WORK_TYPE         - Work-type keyword to keep for every ATS backend except
                         builtin: "remote", "hybrid", "office", "any", or any
                         other literal substring to match
    BUILTIN_LOCATION  - Same as LOCATION (also comma-separated), but for the
                         builtin ATS backend only — independent setting
    BUILTIN_WORK_TYPE - Same as WORK_TYPE, but for the builtin ATS backend
                         only — independent setting
    TITLE_KEYWORDS         - Comma-separated title substrings (OR'd together,
                              case-insensitive); a job title must match at
                              least one to be kept at all, for every ATS
                              backend; also drives one paginated Workday
                              search per entry
    EXCLUDE_TITLE_KEYWORDS - Comma-separated title substrings (OR'd together,
                              case-insensitive); a title matching any of these
                              is dropped even if it also matched

    Company board sizes vary enormously — a few hundred postings for a

    single one of these keywords). Workday's search is a fuzzy full-text
    match, not an exact substring one (e.g. searching "platform" surfaces
    unrelated titles too), so every result is still re-checked with the
    exact _title_looks_relevant filter before being kept — this only saves
