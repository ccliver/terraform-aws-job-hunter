## Project overview

job-hunter is an AWS serverless application that monitors company careers pages and emails a daily digest of new job postings. It uses three Lambda functions orchestrated by EventBridge, with SQS for fan-out, DynamoDB for storage, and SES for email delivery.

```
EventBridge cron → Orchestrator Lambda → SQS (1 msg/company)
                                              ↓
                    Worker Lambda (Greenhouse/Lever/Workday/Built In APIs)
                                              ↓
                                       DynamoDB jobs table
                                              ↑
EventBridge cron (+30min) → Notifier Lambda → SES email digest
```

## Python conventions

- **uv workspace** with three packages under `src/`. Each Lambda has its own `pyproject.toml` so dependencies are isolated per function.
- All handlers follow the same pattern: module-level boto3 clients (`dynamodb = boto3.resource("dynamodb")`), env vars read inside the handler function.
- Job deduplication key: `SHA-256(company|title|url)` → `job_id` DynamoDB partition key. See `worker/handler.py:_make_job_id`.
- `worker/handler.py:_fetch_jobs` dispatches on the `ats` field to one of: `greenhouse`, `lever`, `workday` (all JSON API calls), or `builtin` (scrapes a Built In search results page — server-rendered HTML; aggregates across employers so each job carries its own `company` key and jobs from companies already tracked directly are skipped, via a `dynamodb:Scan` on `COMPANIES_TABLE`). Any other `ats` value (including the historical `unknown` default) logs a warning and returns no jobs — there used to be a Playwright + Strands/Bedrock (Claude Haiku) fallback here, but it was removed: it fundamentally could never extract a job, since it built the LLM's page text via BeautifulSoup's `get_text()`, which strips every `href` attribute, while the prompt required URLs to appear verbatim in that same text.
- `worker/handler.py:_fetch_workday_jobs` issues one paginated search per `_TITLE_KEYWORDS` entry (via Workday's `searchText` param) instead of paginating a company's entire board unfiltered — company board sizes vary from a few hundred to 17,000+ (e.g. CVS, a posting per retail store), and Workday's own search narrows results server-side to a manageable subset regardless of company size, where blanket pagination would either miss postings past an arbitrary cutoff or blow the Lambda timeout entirely. Workday's search is fuzzy full-text, not exact-substring, so every result is still re-checked with `_title_looks_relevant` before being kept; `seen_paths` dedupes postings that surface under more than one keyword so they're not reprocessed (or their description double-fetched).
- `worker/handler.py:_filter_relevant_jobs` also drops jobs indicating a clearance requirement above Public Trust (`_requires_excluded_clearance`), title-only and applied uniformly across every backend. `_fetch_greenhouse_jobs` additionally checks the full job description (Greenhouse's list API returns it for free via `content=true`). `_fetch_workday_jobs` and `_fetch_builtin_jobs` do too, each via a per-posting follow-up request to the job's own detail page/endpoint — but only for postings whose title already passes `_title_looks_relevant`, to avoid one extra request per irrelevant posting; a failed detail fetch falls back to title-only checking rather than dropping the job.
- `worker/handler.py:_filter_relevant_jobs` also drops jobs whose `location` matches `_is_non_us_location` — a word-boundary regex over a curated list of countries/regions/offshore-hub cities (`_NON_US_LOCATION_KEYWORDS`). Defaults to keeping ambiguous locations (bare "Remote", "N Locations", empty) rather than risk hiding a real US posting; deliberately omits US/non-US-ambiguous names (e.g. "Georgia") for the same reason.
- `_fetch_builtin_jobs` additionally applies `_builtin_location_matches`, controlled by the `BUILTIN_LOCATION` (default `""` — disabled) and `BUILTIN_WORK_TYPE` (default `"remote"`) env vars. Built In's own location/remote-preference search filters are client-side JS and are silently ignored by a plain `requests.get` (verified directly), so this is enforced locally against the location text already scraped per job card. Defaults to remote-only, matching the user's manual builtin.com search practice (blank location, Remote checked). Built In renders geography (`fa-location-dot`, e.g. "USA") and work model (`fa-house-building`, e.g. "Remote") as two separate badges on each card; the location text passed to `_builtin_location_matches` combines both (`"USA (Remote)"`) since the geography badge alone rarely contains the literal word "remote" even for fully-remote postings.
- `worker/handler.py:_filter_relevant_jobs` also applies `_location_matches` (`LOCATION`/`WORK_TYPE` env vars, same default remote-only behavior) to every backend except `builtin`, which is exempt — detected via the per-job `"company"` key that only `_fetch_builtin_jobs` sets — since it's already filtered by its own independent `BUILTIN_LOCATION`/`BUILTIN_WORK_TYPE` config. The two settings are deliberately kept separate: the curated company list includes companies chosen for proximity to a future physical location, so a hybrid/on-site preference there shouldn't share Built In's "remote only" default. Both `_location_matches` and `_builtin_location_matches` delegate to the shared `_work_type_matches(location, location_env_var, work_type_env_var, default_location, default_work_type)`.
- `notifier/handler.py:_build_email_body` renders an HTML digest (styled, table-based for email-client compatibility) plus a plain-text fallback, both grouped by company with location shown. All interpolated values are HTML-escaped.
- Lambda handlers return a summary dict (`{"published": n}` etc.) for easy CloudWatch Insights querying.

## Testing conventions

- Tests use **moto** (`@mock_aws` / `with mock_aws()`) for all AWS service mocking — no MagicMock for boto3 calls.
- `src/conftest.py` sets fake AWS credentials and `AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/dev/null` at **module level** (not in a fixture). This is required because handlers create boto3 clients at import time; a fixture would run too late.
- Each test file has an `aws_resources` pytest fixture that creates real moto-backed infrastructure inside `with mock_aws(): ... yield`. Tests run inside that context.
- The `greenhouse`/`lever`/`workday`/`builtin` fetchers make plain `requests` calls and are tested by mocking `requests` directly; `builtin` additionally touches DynamoDB (scans `COMPANIES_TABLE`), which is backed by moto like everything else.
- pytest uses `--import-mode=importlib` (set in root `pyproject.toml`) to avoid module name collisions across the three `test_handler.py` files.
- Add tests for every new handler behaviour; verify state in DynamoDB/SQS directly rather than asserting on mock call counts.

## Terraform conventions

- All resources use `local.prefix` (`"job-hunter"`) for naming.
- Single deployment target — no environment variable, no workspaces.
- Backend config is in `backend.hcl` (gitignored, account-specific) and passed via `terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl`.
- Lambda ZIPs for all three functions (orchestrator, worker, notifier) are built by `task build` (pip-installs dependencies into `terraform/.build/{name}`, then zips); `main.tf` just references the resulting `.build/*.zip` via `filebase64sha256` for `source_code_hash`. The worker previously shipped as a container image (needed for a since-removed Playwright + Bedrock dependency — see the `worker/handler.py` note above); it was converted back to a plain zip package once that dependency was gone, dropping the ECR repository and the manual `aws lambda update-function-code` deploy step entirely.
- IAM policies follow least-privilege per Lambda.
- SQS queues use `sqs_managed_sse_enabled = true`.
- DynamoDB tables use `PAY_PER_REQUEST` billing.

## Open TODOs

- `orchestrator/handler.py`: add DynamoDB scan pagination for large company lists.
- `terraform/main.tf` jobs table: add GSI on `discovered_at` for efficient Notifier time-range queries (currently full table scan).

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs two jobs on PRs and pushes to main:
1. **pre-commit** — runs all hooks (`ruff`, `ty`, `terraform_fmt`, `terraform_validate`, `terraform_docs`, `terraform_tflint`, `terraform_checkov`, `check-merge-conflict`, `end-of-file-fixer`). Requires terraform, tflint (v0.55.0), checkov (v3.2.526), and terraform-docs (v0.24.0) installed as separate steps before the pre-commit run. The `terraform_docs` hook shells out to whatever `terraform-docs` is on PATH (no bundled/pinned version of its own), so this CI pin must be kept in sync with whatever version is used for local development — a mismatch causes CI to "detect" a diff in `terraform/README.md` that doesn't reproduce locally.
2. **Tests** — `uv run pytest --tb=short -q`

pytest (`stages: [pre-push]`) is excluded from the pre-commit job since it runs in the dedicated test job.
